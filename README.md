### WTF?

Once upon a time, I was bored on a "random project generator" website
and decided to get like a couple thousand names from the website's API.

Fast forward some time, I found the saved names on a file inside my external hard drive
and decided to process the file using some text processing, so I could know
what the original prefixes and suffixes were.

Sooo... this repository is basically what I did to process the file.
